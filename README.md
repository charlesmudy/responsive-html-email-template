This template is designed to work on all major email platforms and it is built with media query, making it responsive for smartphones that supports media query. It serves as a foundation that has been tested and thoroughly reviewed for compatibility, very easy to customize and make changes.

Using MailChimp's html email template (blue-print) as the foundation, this template is an improved version with more row options, re-defined structure and many fixes for Outlook, Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail e.t.c.
